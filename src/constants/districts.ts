/**
 * The 64 districts of Bangladesh, grouped into their 8 divisions.
 *
 * A code constant, not a database table, and deliberately so. Districts are a fact about
 * the country: they change on the scale of years, and a list the admin can edit is a list
 * that can be wrong. Because the district decides the delivery fee, one typo here would
 * quietly undercharge or overcharge deliveries for as long as it existed, with nothing in
 * the app able to report it. Making it an admin-editable table would move that failure
 * from "caught by verify:sql-sync" to "found by a customer".
 *
 * Spellings are the government's post-2018 English forms — Bogura, Barishal, Jashore,
 * Chattogram, Cumilla — not the older Bogra/Barisal/Jessore/Chittagong/Comilla. Customers
 * and delivery riders use the current names, and mixing the two spellings is how the same
 * district ends up stored two different ways.
 *
 * `name` is the canonical value stored in `addresses.county` and compared by the delivery
 * fee rule, so it must be exactly one of these strings. `bn` is the Bangla name, shown as
 * a subtitle because this is how customers actually look for their own district.
 *
 * Verified mechanically by supabase/verify-sql-sync.mjs: exactly 64, no duplicate names,
 * every district carries a Bangla name, and the 8 division totals sum to 64. The count
 * matters — a district silently dropped from this list is a district no customer can
 * select, and they would not know why.
